                "I got the opportunity to work with Joel for about two and a
                half years and I can confidently say he is one of the most
                determined and hard working team members I have had the pleasure
                of working with. One thing which I admire the most about Joel is
                his enthusiasm to learn and explore new things. There was never
                a dull moment working with him because of how interested he will
                be to execute any given task whether it is small or big and his
                fun filled energy made the process so joyful. Along with
                completing his task with utmost quality and stability he also
                was always keen to collaborate with other team members to
                understand and learn about the projects they were working on.
                Apart from being extremely proficient in technical aspects Joel
                has always proved to be great team player by actively
                collaborating with team from onsite and offshore, may it be for
                solution design, discovery session or mentoring the young
                developer and it immensely help the team in many ways. Joel's
                communication skill is top notch and has always been incredibly
                articulate in expressing his thoughts and his presentation
                skills are truly masterful. Finally, Joel is a great human being
                and truly talented individual. He would excel in anything he
                pursued and I wholeheartedly endorse him for any reputable
                organisation."
